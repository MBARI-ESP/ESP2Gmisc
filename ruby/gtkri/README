to support Ruby v1.9

gtkri (aka myri) is an obsolete, but very nice
GUI for Pragmatic Programmers "Interactive Ruby" [ri] command.
It also requires ruby binding to GTK v1.2 (not v2.x!)

This version has been hack to operate until Ruby v1.9

So, you need:
/usr/lib/libgtk-1.2.so.*

To build the patched bindings to GTK 1.2 for Ruby v1.9:

$ tar xzf ruby-gtk-0.34.tar.gz
$ cd ruby-gtk-0.34
$ patch -p1 < ../ruby19-gtk-0.34.patch
$ ruby19 extconf.rb
$ make
$ su
# make install

#to install the GUI script that uses them as the command gtkri:

# cd ..  #back to top level dir
# cp gtkri /usr/local/bin
