Revised:  10/15/09 by brent@mbari.org
to add missing rbgkcursors dependency
to support Ruby v1.8 and v1.9

gtkri (aka myri) is an obsolete, but very nice
GUI for Pragmatic Programmers "Interactive Ruby" [ri] command.
It also requires ruby binding to GTK v1.2 (not v2.x!)

First, install the text mode ri command at ../ri

This version has been hack to operate until Ruby v1.9

So, you need:
/usr/lib/libgtk-1.2.so.*

To build the patched bindings to GTK 1.2 for Ruby v1.9:

$ tar xzf ruby-gtk-0.34.tar.gz
$ cd ruby-gtk-0.34

# apply this patch only if targeting ruby v1.9 or later
$ patch -p1 < ../ruby19-gtk-0.34.patch  #skip this for ruby 1.6.8 or 1.8.*

$ ruby extconf.rb

# edit src/Makefile to 
#   add rbgdkcursors.h as a dependency to build rule for rbgdkcursor.o
# rbgdkcursor.o: rbgdkcursor.c rbgtk.h global.h rbgdkcursors.h

$ make
$ su
# make install

#to install the GUI script that uses them as the command gtkri:

# cd ..  #back to top level dir
# cp gtkri /usr/local/bin
