2001-08-18  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* ri/ri.rb: Fix bug which failed to match plain 'blksize' because
	it couldn't parse out the classname part (File::Stat)

2001-08-15  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* ri/ri.rb: Re-organize to allow can_handle? to be implemented

2001-08-13  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* install.rb: Add support for DESTDIR (patch from Christian
	Lademann)

	* ri/ri.rb (defined?): New method to fid out if a particular
	name exists
	* post_process: convert --@ to -@ in a method name. (I can't to it
	in the text - there are too many other occurances of --).

	* ri_cmd.rb: You can now specify the name of a .rb file for the
	output format routine. Any argument to -f that contains a '/' or
	that ends in .rb will be loaded directly.

	formatter for method names.

2001-03-06  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* ri.rb: Add --synopsis switch

	* ri.rb: Split off output methods, and add -f switch to allow
	differnt output methods to be selected. Implemented Plain and
	Tagged.

	other code

	* ref_to_simple.xsl: Ignore new fullcode tag.

	* post_process.rb: remove spaces in some punctuation-only method
	names. 

	* rb.rb: change abbreviation handling. Now properly looks for
	leading matches, and deals with case when both class and method
	names are abbreviated.

2001-02-26  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* install.rb: CONFIG["sitedir"] isn't set in 1.4.3 Ruby, so fake
	it out.

	* ri.rb: Add Ribert Feldt's code to allow abbreviations of class
	and method names.

	* install.rb: Change installation so that I no longer distribute
 	binary files.

	* ri.rb: Add --version and --line-length

2001-02-25  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	wrapped text.

	* ri.rb: Map '_' back to ':' when displaying a list of class
	filenames.

	* ri.rb: Handle class names with ':'s better, and map ':' to '_'
	in external file names for DOS users.
