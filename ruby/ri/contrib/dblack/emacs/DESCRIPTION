Emacs support, by David Alan Black (dblack@candle.superlink.net)

Provide three kinds of support for 'ri' inside emacs:

- simple interactive query

- a browsable index, where you can follow links to do things like
  drill down on the methods within a class or module.

- pop-up help on the class or method under point.
